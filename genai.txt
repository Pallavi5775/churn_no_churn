Generate text based on prompts.
Tools: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Google Colab.
2. Image Generation with GANs
Goal: Generate simple images (e.g., handwritten digits, basic shapes).

What to Do:

Train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digits.
Experiment with improving the quality of generated images.
Tools: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

Datasets: MNIST dataset.

3. Music Generation
Goal: Generate basic melodies using AI.

What to Do:

Use a library like Magenta to generate music.
Train a simple RNN or Transformer-based model to generate MIDI files.
Tools: Magenta, TensorFlow, Python.

Datasets: MAESTRO Dataset.

4. Text-to-Image Generation
Goal: Create a model that generates images from textual descriptions.

What to Do:

Use pre-trained models like DALL·E Mini to generate images.
Input a description (e.g., "a cat playing a guitar") and visualize the output.
Tools: Hugging Face Spaces, DALL·E API.

5. Style Transfer for Images
Goal: Transfer the artistic style of one image onto another.

What to Do:

Use a neural style transfer algorithm to combine the content of one image with the style of another.
Experiment with different style images (e.g., famous paintings).
Tools: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

Datasets: Any image dataset (e.g., Flickr).

6. Chatbot Using GPT
Goal: Build a simple chatbot that responds to user queries.

What to Do:

Use GPT-based models from Hugging Face to build a conversational agent.
Fine-tune it for specific tasks (e.g., a customer support bot).
Tools: Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Flask/Django (for deployment).

7. Image Inpainting (Filling Missing Parts of Images)
Goal: Create a tool to repair or reconstruct missing parts of an image.

What to Do:

Use OpenCV to preprocess the image and TensorFlow/Keras for the inpainting model.
Train on datasets with masked images and their corresponding originals.
Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV.

Datasets: Places Dataset.

8. Face Aging with GANs
Goal: Generate aged versions of faces using conditional GANs.

What to Do:

Train a GAN (or use a pre-trained one) to simulate aging effects on facial images.
Use age progression datasets for training.
Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras.

Datasets: UTKFace Dataset.

9. Text Summarization
Goal: Create a summarizer for articles, blogs, or books.

What to Do:

Use a Transformer-based model (e.g., BART or T5) to summarize input text.
Experiment with summarizing content from Wikipedia or news articles.
Tools: Hugging Face Transformers, Python.

Datasets: CNN/DailyMail Dataset.

10. Fake News Detection with BERT
Goal: Use generative models to create fake news articles and classify them.

What to Do:

Generate fake articles using GPT.
Train a classifier (e.g., BERT) to distinguish between real and fake articles.
Tools: Python, Hugging Face Transformers.

Datasets: LIAR Dataset.

11. Anime Face Generator
Goal: Generate anime-style faces using a pre-trained GAN.

Experiment with tweaking hyperparameters for more unique outputs.
Tools: PyTorch, TensorFlow.

Datasets: Anime Face Dataset.

12. Image Captioning
Goal: Automatically generate captions for images.

What to Do:

Train a model that combines CNNs (for image features) and RNNs (for caption generation).
Use datasets with image-caption pairs.
Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch.

Datasets: Flickr8k.
